## What is the point of a web server?
Web servers are meant to process HTTP (Internet Protocol) requests. HTTP
also allows the web server to store and protect data, control bandwidth of a web server, and to make web pages using differrent languages like Python, JavaScript, or PhP.


## Running Scripts

Scripts can often mean sending scripts from the server to the client in order to be able to make a web page more dynamic and customizable than a static one.

### Example:

Many business will put style into their Websites to look more professional. A great example is Jack in the Box's website. They use Javascript on their website to send a design of the website that is much more visually appealing than one. Using scripts they are able to send this ideal design by just sending the client a file. The client can then recieve the web page not only in a much fancier design, but also a much more faster speed to communicate with the server.

## Serverless Architecture

Serverless Architecture is the simple process of building and managing applications without an underlying architecture. Developers can rely on third party servers to keep servers up, while they can just maintain and regulate their code.

### Example

Serverless Architecture is used for hosts like MLB's Website's statcast page. It allows for Users to be able to look up stats about players, games, and even types of swing. They are able to use an infastruture that allows this data to be updated accurately, meanwhile all the developers have to do is upload their code and let the providers handle the rest.

## Cloud Computing


Cloud computing means using computing services like storage, 
applications, or processing power over the internet 
instead of relying only on your own device.
Powerful performs tasks over the internet.
### Example:

 Cloud storage can store data and files on the internet through
 a public or private network connection.They do this through their large data centers 
 around the world. As you pay for storage, the web servers will keep access to your 
 data over the length of how many months, along with other aspects such as it's security, 
 the size of the storage, and the ability to keep the hardware running efficently.
 High performance is key to prevent issues such as buffering or lag.

 ## Databases


Databases are organized collections of information, or data,
that are stored in a way that makes it easy to access, manage, and update.
Databases are essential for organizing and managing large amounts of information efficiently.
Web servers as a result will communicate with web servers to find certain databases.

   How Databases interact with web services: https://www.upi.pr.it/docs/easfg/easvrfgp10.htm 
### Example: 
In schools, databases can be largely used in order to store certain data like the
grades of the students. Students can also be tracked on the amount of assigments
they have completed. Streaming Services like Netflix also use databases
by storing movies and tv shows, and recommended watch history.

## Media
In media, web servers play a crucial role in delivering digital content like 
images, videos, music, and websites to users. A web server uses media to send small parts called packets to the user, which are different parts of the video that it downloads, and decompresses each packet. It then is able to use these packets together to show the full movie.
